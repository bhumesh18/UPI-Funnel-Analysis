# ðŸ“Š UPI Transaction Funnel Analysis

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
An end-to-end **Product Analyst project** analyzing UPI transaction funnels (init â†’ amount_entered â†’ PIN â†’ bank_auth â†’ completed).  
Covers **SQL, Python, and Tableau**, simulating real product analytics work.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Understand user drop-offs in a UPI transaction journey:
- Where do most users drop off?
- How do banks and devices compare?
- What errors cause failures?
- What is the average time-to-complete?

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tools Used
- **SQL (DBeaver + SQLite)** â†’ Funnel queries
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter)** â†’ Time & Error analysis
- **Tableau Public** â†’ Interactive dashboard

---

## ðŸ”¹ Analysis Performed
1. **SQL**
   - Global funnel counts
   - Per-bank and per-device funnels

2. **Python**
   - Average transaction time (init â†’ completed)
   - Error breakdown by bank & device

3. **Tableau**
   - Funnel dashboard with conversion %
   - Segmented funnels (bank/device)
   - Error & time visualizations

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights
- Biggest drop-off: **Completed stage (87% after BankAuth)**  
- SBI has longer completion times (~4.2s vs HDFC ~2.9s)  
- Top error: **NETWORK_TIMEOUT (35% of SBI failures)**  
- Overall funnel completion: **79%**
